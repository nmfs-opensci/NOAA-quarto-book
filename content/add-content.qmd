## Edit and add your pages

Edit the qmd or md files in the `content` folder. qmd files can include code (R, Python, Julia) and lots of Quarto markdown bells and whistles (like call-outs, cross-references, auto-citations and much more).

Each page should start with 
```
---
title: your title
---
```
and the first header will be the 2nd level, so `## `. Note, there are situations where you leave off
```
---
title: your title
---
```
and start the qmd file with a level header `# `, but if using the default title yaml (in the `---` fence) is a good habit since it makes it easy for Quarto convert your qmd file to other formats (like into a presentation).

## Add your pages the project

* Add the files to `_quarto.yml`
