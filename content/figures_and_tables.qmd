```

Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

## Code

You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots and reference them, like so @fig-pressure.

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
#| label: fig-pressure
#| fig-cap: "Plot of pressure"
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## Including Tables

You can also embed tables and reference them with @tbl-iris.

```{r}
#| label: tbl-iris
#| tbl-cap: "Iris Data"

library(knitr)
kable(head(iris))
```
