# NOAA quarto simple website with R in qmd or Rmd files

This is a template for [a simple Quarto website](https://nmfs-opensci.github.io/NOAA-quarto-simple/) (`type: website`). It looks like a html book (`type: book`) but unlike the book type it only has html format and you will not have the download options. `type: website` is a common format for documentation. 

The repo includes a GitHub Action that will build the website automatically when you make changes to the files. The webpage will use the `gh-pages` branch. Serving the website files from this branch is a common way to keep all the website files from cluttering your main branch. 

*Note: The GitHub Action installs R so you can render qmd files with R code. You will need to edit to install Python or Julia if your qmd uses those instead. If you have substantial computations, you don't want to be re-running all the computations for files that didn't change. Read about the [freeze option](https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/ci.html) for this situation. R users with complex reports with dependencies (so qmd B depends on qmd A or data file A) should be aware of the {targets} package which will help you keep track of files that need to be re-rendered due to changes in dependencies.*

## GitHub Set-up

* Click the green "Use This Template" button to make a repository with this content. Make sure to make your repo public (since GitHub Pages doesn't work on private repos unless you have a paid account) and check box to include all the branches (so that you get the gh-pages branch).

* Turn on GitHub Pages under Settings > Pages . You will set pages to be made from the gh-pages branch and root directory.

* Edit the repo description and Readme to add a link to the webpage. When you edit the description, you will see the link url in the url box or you can click on the Actions tab or the  Settings > Pages page to find the url to the Quarto website

## Customize

* Edit the qmd or md files in the `content` folder. qmd files can include code (R, Python, Julia) and lots of Quarto markdown bells and whistles (like call-outs, cross-references, auto-citations and much more).
* Add the files to `_quarto.yml`
